# Cleanup validation and measured bottlenecks

## 2026-10-05 station offline benchmarks

**Keep offline GPU batching enabled; keep BVH optional.** Batching reduced the short station recording's high-quality GPU render from **1.020 s to 0.361 s (2.83×)** with byte-identical responses and audio. BVH helped CPU rendering during the short, mostly stationary take, but its moving-geometry maintenance cost outweighed traversal savings in the three-lap take. The station still defaults to CPU with `useBvh=false`; offline GPU renders use the existing 64-response batch setting. No scene objects or sound assets changed for these measurements.

### Workload and timing

Measured in the actual project's Unity **6000.4.1f1** Editor on **Apple M5 / Metal**, in Edit mode. Both recordings use the real TrainStation geometry: **53 objects, 564 triangles, two sources, one binaural listener**, 44,100 Hz stereo, linear fractional delay, 64-sample transitions and no appended tail. The take fixes the scene, recorded motion and source events for every run.

| Recording under `Recordings/` | Duration | Output frames | Low responses | High responses |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `station-20261005-195909-093` | 12.701315 s | 560,128 | 274 | 2,188 |
| `station-20261005-192306-273` | 95.805556 s | 4,225,025 | 2,064 | 16,505 |

Low uses a **2,048-sample response step** (46.44 ms); High uses **256 samples** (5.805 ms). Both use the same direct/opaque transport and binaural DSP. These labels change response cadence, not reflection fidelity, sample rate or ray count; neither is an approved reflection-training reference.

Each case has one discarded warmup and three measured repetitions, alternating case order. Tables show median **whole-render wall seconds**, including opening/checking the take, preparation, motion evaluation, tracing, GPU staging/readback waits, DSP, writing WAV/responses and final output hashes/reports. File caches are warm. The harness report and duplicate-output deletion happen outside this timer. Component times below come from the median-total repetition; they are not independent medians.

Inputs here are existing full diagnostic takes. **Reconstructing compact inputs into a numeric take is a separate, untimed preparation step**, shared by Low and High. No gameplay/physics rerun, visual rendering or live audio deadline is included. These results measure offline throughput, not live latency. At CPU High, only 20.62% of short-take frames and 2.74% of long-take frames contain nonzero audio under the direct/opaque model. Do not extrapolate their DSP cost to continuously audible scenes or reflections. Larger geometry and DirectX remain unmeasured.

### Whole-render results

Short recording, seconds:

| Implementation | CPU Low | CPU High | GPU Low | GPU High |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Original brute force, synchronous GPU | 0.201 | 0.452 | 0.313 | 1.020 |
| BVH, full hierarchy refit | 0.207 | 0.410 | 0.314 | 0.979 |
| BVH, refit affected branches | 0.193 | 0.384 | 0.283 | 0.933 |
| Brute force, GPU batches of 64 | 0.204 | 0.449 | 0.205 | **0.361** |
| BVH, GPU batches of 64 | 0.198 | **0.390** | 0.213 | 0.423 |

The final brute-force GPU High range was **0.358–0.371 s**, versus **0.995–1.175 s** originally. Its solve/staging/readback time fell from 0.636 s to 0.035 s. Batching removes thousands of individual waits; it does not change intersection physics. CPU execution still solves one response at a time. The small Low CPU differences are within observed run variation; one BVH Low repetition took 0.502 s, retained in the raw data.

Three-lap recording, median seconds (minimum–maximum):

| Backend | Brute force | BVH |
|---|---:|---:|
| CPU Low | **0.928** (0.921–0.953) | 0.982 (0.953–0.983) |
| CPU High | **2.462** (2.454–2.672) | 2.598 (2.582–2.663) |
| GPU Low, batch 64 | 1.126 (0.933–1.130) | 1.019 (0.973–1.038) |
| GPU High, batch 64 | **2.007** (1.973–2.023) | 3.057 (2.729–3.144) |

BVH High regressed 5.5% on CPU. High solve time, including BVH maintenance, rose from 0.689 to 0.819 s on CPU and from 0.226 to 0.910 s on GPU. GPU BVH also stages a hierarchy per response frame; its reported numeric working buffers grow from 2,860,130 to 5,130,253 bytes. These are buffer estimates, not total process memory. Low GPU totals overlap substantially and include variable file-writing costs, so they do not establish a BVH improvement. There was no synchronous-GPU baseline run for the long take.

### Remaining costs

Final brute-force GPU High, seconds:

| Work | Short take | Three-lap take |
|---|---:|---:|
| Open/validate inputs | 0.016 | 0.034 |
| Prepare renderer | 0.015 | 0.050 |
| Evaluate recorded motion | 0.116 | 0.861 |
| Solve, stage and wait for readback | 0.035 | 0.226 |
| Audio DSP | 0.082 | 0.094 |
| Write responses/WAV | 0.047 | 0.378 |
| Final hashes/report/disposal | 0.024 | 0.178 |
| Total, including other loop/setup work | **0.361** | **2.007** |

Motion evaluation is the largest measured component after batching. Output writing and hashing also matter. Optimize those only against the same recordings and exact-output checks. BVH build/update and upload/dispatch counters are nested diagnostics, not extra times to add to the table. With asynchronous batches, `dispatchReadbackSeconds` measures submission work; it is **not GPU kernel execution time**. `solveSeconds` includes the completion wait. The total does not require estimating GPU execution from CPU submission timestamps.

### Correctness and preserved history

All optimized short-run `responses.bin` and stereo WAVs match the baseline **byte-for-byte within each backend**, at both qualities. Long-run BVH and brute-force outputs also match exactly. Every repetition matches its own case's hashes. CPU versus GPU retains the original small numerical differences: short-take RMS error 7.22–7.87e-8, maximum 2.53e-6; long-take RMS 2.45–2.50e-8, maximum 2.18e-6. Cross-backend output is not claimed byte-identical.

**1,387 core checks plus Metal FFT/direct/BVH/batched/live-offline checks passed.** Coverage includes 2D/3D, moving/rotating/inactive/empty geometry, multiple source/listener pairs, zero-allocation warmed CPU solves and batch sizes 1/3/8/64 preserving responses and audio with cuts, gain/stop events, tails, multiple listeners and both delay filters. The Editor was left in Edit mode with TrainStation clean and the manager Idle.

| Git revision | Preserved implementation |
|---|---|
| `877c21c` | Original renderer plus repeatable benchmark harness; before BVH/batching changes. |
| `7c892fc` | CPU/HLSL BVH and brute-force correctness comparisons. |
| `2c9ffb6` | Refit only hierarchy branches affected by moved geometry. |
| `0d6e11b` | Offline GPU response batching with exact-output checks. |
| `fdb6ec8` | Keep one inspectable output per benchmark case; measured code used for long runs. |

Old source is kept in Git, without duplicate runtime files. [Raw measured samples](benchmarks/station-2026-10-05.csv) preserve all **84 measured renders**, full revisions, input/output hashes, settings that vary and timing components. Full local reports and one output per case live under `.context/traversal-benchmark/{baseline,bvh,sparse,batched-brute,batched-bvh,long-brute,long-bvh}/`; recordings and binary outputs are not committed.

### Reproduction

In the graphics-enabled Editor, stop Play and invoke [DirectBenchmark.Run](../Assets/Editor/DirectBenchmark.cs) from an Editor script/native Unity CLI wrapper. It uses immutable recorded geometry rather than the open scene. For the measured settings:

```csharp
DirectBenchmark.Run(
    "Recordings/station-20261005-192306-273",
    ".context/benchmarks/new-run", // Must not exist.
    "<current git rev-parse HEAD>",
    new TakeRender.Settings {
        listenerOutput = TakeRender.ListenerOutput.Binaural,
        delayFilter = TakeRender.DelayFilter.Linear,
        transitionSamples = 64,
        maximumResponsesPerBatch = 64,
        useBvh = false
    }, lowStep: 2048, highStep: 256, repetitions: 3);
```

The async Editor operation writes progress to `benchmark.json`; wait for `complete=true` and an empty `error`. Switch `useBvh` for the traversal comparison. Set `maximumResponsesPerBatch=1` for the original synchronous GPU scheduling. For a new compact recording, reconstruct once using its matching scene/code revision, then supply the generated numeric take to this harness. Do not launch a second Editor against the already-open project. The harness requires a graphics device; CPU-only `-nographics` jobs remain supported by `TakeBatch.Render` separately.

## 2026-10-05 compact capture cleanup

- Removed unreferenced `TrainVisualLoader` and `AudioConvolve`, plus the duplicate FFT scene/component. Automated FFT/direct GPU checks remain.
- Reduced `ComputeHelper` from 553 to 101 lines. Legacy manager/audio code now lives in explicit partial files, retaining serialized component references; current Inspectors omit legacy controls.
- Station capture writes input states, sample/tick timing, source events, identity metadata and small diagnostics by default. Full poses/geometry/PCM/output audio are optional diagnostic reference data.
- `StationReplay` reconstructs in Edit mode and is shared by Inspector rendering and batch jobs. It uses public scene/controller/audio preparation APIs and the same initialized simulation step. Explicit ground queries replace reliance on Play-only collision callbacks.
- 397 core checks and Metal FFT/direct/batched/live-versus-offline checks passed. The three-lap, 4,801-tick recording reconstructed byte-identical states/events and stereo audio across 4,225,025 frames; its five replay files occupied 39,176 bytes. Artifact: `Recordings/station-20261005-192306-273/`.
- A clean Git checkout at `2ad3c7e` and a fresh batch Editor (`-nographics`, no live audio) rebuilt a normal six-file recording. State/event hashes and all 896,001 non-silent stereo frames matched the original Editor's offline reconstruction exactly. The generated comparison opened successfully in the native comparison window. Inputs: `Recordings/station-20261005-194749-220/`; job, output and equality report: `.context/cleanup/checkout-job-final.json`, `checkout-render-final/`, `checkout-comparison-final.json`.
- That recovery test exposed unstable compiler module IDs across checkout directories. New Editor recordings validate relative project paths and file contents instead; older recordings and Player builds retain their original identity checks. Matching Git history supplies the files, but automatic checkout is still not implemented.
- Batch parsing now preserves absent/null comparison and reference jobs. Unity's inline JSON serializer previously instantiated those optional objects, triggering unrequested work. The parser uses the already-installed Json.NET 3.2.2 package, now declared directly. Regression checks cover optional jobs; the final batch run produced only `low/` and `high/`, with no reference render.
- A separate replay cadence test measured 4.90 and 9.99 FPS with identical final scene positions. The test deliberately throttles the Editor; it checks simulation accuracy, not uninterrupted output at those cadences. Artifact: `Recordings/station-20261005-193400-102/`.
- The default station now uses CPU tracing and 8,192 lead frames (185.8 ms at 44.1 kHz), down from 24,000 (544.2 ms). A 32.6-second standalone Mac run recorded only six compact files, with zero underrun/late/overflow samples. Maximum observation gap: 1,025 samples; maximum direct solve: 0.996 ms. Built app and report: `.context/cleanup/Station.app`, `.context/cleanup/player-result.json`.
- The background Editor remained near 10 FPS even with higher requested frame-rate caps. The three-lap capture had one 1,024-sample deadline miss and a 9,215-sample observation gap. Replay can also miss deadlines at this cadence or during script compilation. The smaller lead is not a guarantee against Editor stalls. Standalone measurements are reported separately.

## Earlier measurements

Historical measurements from 2026-09-29: Unity 6000.4.1f1, Apple M5 CPU/GPU, Metal, using an isolated validation project. At that time the main project was still on Unity 2022.3.62f3; it has since migrated to Unity 6000.4.1f1. The numbers below are unchanged, were not rerun for the documentation consolidation, and do not establish Windows/DirectX results. See the [README](../README.md) for current operation and [design contract](simulation-contracts.md) for planned work.

## Correctness

- 263 CPU checks passed, including input mutation rejection, immutable observed knots, bounded long-session history, analytic fractional-delay FIR accuracy, live/offline equality, recorder wrap/overflow, concurrent capture finalization, and reference acceptance/rejection.
- GPU FFT, transformed 2D/3D direct fixtures, batched asynchronous completion/disposal and live/offline equality with both delay filters passed on Metal.
- CPU and GPU Play-mode walkthroughs completed with editable native objects, moving listener/occluder, source events, saved input/output files and subsequent offline comparisons. Disabling the manager released its session and output queue.
- The actual Editor CLI completed a three-budget comparison. An exact-agreement reference gate rejected the moving take while leaving its completed measurement outputs available.
- No runtime files, packages or assembly boundaries were added for this cleanup. The existing implementation files were extended.

## Scene validation

The warmed mesh/material fixture performed 1,000 validations with zero managed allocations. Its total duration was about 3.2 ms. Snapshots compare shared mesh data and authored shape/material inputs; they do not regenerate scene geometry.

The earlier walkthrough spent 778 ms validating 26,632 polls, including duplicate audio timestamps. The final CPU walkthrough spent **2.76 ms** across **130** validations; 28,451 duplicate polls serviced pending rendering without revalidating or rewriting accepted poses. Maximum validation cost was 43.8 microseconds. Preparation, including snapshot warmup, is reported separately (35.4 ms in this run). These are observations from comparable three-second runs, not a general speedup guarantee.

## Live output

Both walkthroughs used one source/listener, 60 triangles, 44,100 Hz audio, a 256-sample response step and a 4,096-sample monitoring lead (92.9 ms). They recorded 129 distinct pose observations each. Both reported zero underrun, late, overflow and over-budget callback samples/counts at producer stop; output capture finalized without overflow.

The CPU run used linear delay filtering; the GPU run exercised a 16-sample-radius causal windowed-sinc filter. Their DSP times therefore represent different configurations. GPU maximum submit-to-consumption completion time was 14.74 ms. Output WAVs preserve component PCM before downstream Unity mixer/device processing, and callback records include the DSP clock relative to the take origin.

## Direct traversal throughput

Controlled all-miss fixture: 16 source/listener pairs, static triangles outside every path, warmed backend, eight measured calls per case. CPU and synchronous GPU calls each solve one response frame. GPU batches contain eight frames per call; their column divides elapsed batch time by eight. All GPU figures include readback/wait overhead. This measures throughput; batch latency and live scheduling must be assessed separately.

| Triangles | CPU ms/response | GPU sync ms/response | GPU batch ms/response |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 64 | 0.209 | 0.388 | 0.051 |
| 4096 | 13.010 | 3.633 | 0.204 |
| 65536 | 207.502 | 25.780 | 2.939 |

At the time of these earlier measurements, traversal scanned every primitive per pair. The near-linear scaling motivated the optional BVH now measured above; large-scene BVH scaling has not yet been rerun. Batching reduces dispatch/readback overhead but does not change the brute-force traversal algorithm. Configurable FFT/STFT, validated indirect responses and converged ray-budget training references remain future work.

## Reproduction

Run `TakeChecks.Run` or `TakeChecks.RunGpu` with Unity's `-executeMethod` flag; omit `-nographics` for GPU checks. The walkthrough and controlled traversal automation, logs, CSV, takes, monitored PCM, offline renders and CLI outputs are retained locally under `.context/validation/cleanup/`. The temporary automation is outside the runtime codebase.

Unity Editor SearchDatabase logged its previously observed startup indexing exception during Play-mode entry. The capture, finalization and comparison checks above completed. This issue is recorded in the retained logs; no project upgrade was made during these cleanup measurements. The subsequent main-project migration is separate from this report.
